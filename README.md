# NetworkConfiguration
Configured a virtual Network utilizing a Catalyst 3560-CX switch wiht PuTTY. Created access and trunk VLANs, as well as ether channels. Enabled layer 3 IP routing and Spanning-Tree Protocol. Manually configured static ip addresses, as well as dynamic addresses with OSPF and EIGRP. Enabled DR/BDR. Finally, I created a logical topology using Visio.
