# NetworkConfiguration
## Overview
Configured a virtual Network utilizing a Catalyst 3560-CX switch wiht PuTTY. Finally, I created a logical topology using Visio. Utilizing virtual local area networks, I was able to connect endpoints to the internet, as well as divide broadcast domains so as to not congest the network. I also configured PVST+ spanning-tree protocol and port channels with LACP, to further decrease network traffic amongst a single link. Using static and dynamic IP adddress OSPF and EIGRP, I allowed for dynamically-learned IP addresses. 

Special thanks to the folks at OnePPPO, of the Department of Energy. They gave me the switch to play with for the summer, allowing me to do this mini project. I learned so much, and I was able to apply a lot of my CCNA studies towards this project. 

## Purpose of Lab
The purpose of this lab was meant to further understand how to configure and enable devices to speak to each other, as well as optimize network traffic. This lab also reinforced important networking concepts, vital to both my CCNA studies and companies.
